Other assessments:

Kanban, TDD & Pair Programming - These are the agile framework and techniques for the software development. 

TDD: Test driven development will be the agile way to test the code before implementation. Fail the test case and try to implement to pass the test cases. We are using the gradle for the same.
Pair Programming: Pair programming will help the two developers in agile development to deliver the work in a faster way with code review by each others.

CI/CD: I'm using bamboo as a CI/CD process to build different plan for the code integration and testing. We have different plans to run on different environment.

Squad service ownership: I used to interact with the support issues by the customer depends on the business priority.
